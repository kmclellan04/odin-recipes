    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p>This Pan-Seared Steak has a garlic rosemary-infused butter that makes it taste steakhouse quality. You’ll be impressed at how easy it is to make the perfect steak – seared and caramelized on the outside, and so juicy inside.</p>
    <p>This recipe takes <strong>5</strong> minutes to prepare, <strong> 15 </strong> minutes to cook and makes <strong>4</strong> servings</p>
    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs New York Strip Steaks (2 steaks). <em> Replace with other cuts of steak as desired.</em></li>
        <li>1/2 Tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1.5 tsp sea salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp black pepper, freshly grounded</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, peeled and quartered</li>
        <li>1 sprig fresh rosemary</li>
    </ul>
    <h2> Directions </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Thoroughly pat steak dry with paper towels.</li>
        <li>Just before cooking, generously season with 1 1/2 tsp salt and 1 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>Heat the cast iron pan until hot then add 1/2 Tbsp oil over medium-high heat, swirling to coat. </li>
        <li>Once the oil is very hot, add steaks to the skillet. Sear the steaks on the first side for 4 minutes until a brown crust has formed then flip and cook another 3-4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Using tongs, turn the steak on its sides to render the white fat and sear the edges (1-minute per edge).</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium and immediately add 2 Tbsp butter, quartered garlic cloves and rosemary to the pan.</li>
        <li>Spoon the butter sauce over the steak, tilting the pan to get butter on your spoon. Continue spooning the sauce over the steak for a minute or until the steak is about 5-10 degrees from your desired doneness <em>(the temperature will continue to rise another 5-10 degrees while steaks rest)</em>.</li>
        <li>Transfer steak to a cutting board, loosely cover and rest 10 minutes before slicing into 1/2" strips to serve.</li>
        <li>Spoon extra butter sauce over sliced steak to serve.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
